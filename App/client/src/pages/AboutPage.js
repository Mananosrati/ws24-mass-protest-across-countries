      <p>
        Meet Find My Protest, a website designed for Berlin residents who care
        about what's happening in their city and want to get involved in
        protests. We created this platform to make it easy for people to find
        out about upcoming protests in their neighbourhood and join in if they
        want to. Our team includes designers, developers, and data experts who
        all want to use their skills to help our city. Together, we're focused
        on making it easier for everyone to be informed and engaged in local
        activism. Our main goal is to provide a place where you can find
        information about protests happening in Berlin. We also want to give you
        an idea of how big the protests might be, so you can decide if you want
        to participate. Find My Protest is here to connect Berliners with the
        causes they care about, making it simple for people to have their voices
        heard and make a difference in our community. Join us as we work towards
        a more involved, informed, and united Berlin, where everyone has the
        opportunity to contribute to positive change.
